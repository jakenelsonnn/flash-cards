{"question":"In an SDN, what is the function of the data plane (infrastructure layer)?","answer":"Responsible for the routing of network frames and packets; Contains the physical components of the SDN such as switches, routers, and other network devices; Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT (network address translation)."},
{"question":"In SDN (Software Defined Network), what is the function of the Control Plane (control layer)?","answer":"The bridge between the infrastructure layer (data plane) and the application layer (management plane); hosts the SDN controller; contains and manages routing tables, session tables, NAT tables, using those tables to take action on where the data should go. Essentially, does everything necessary to tell the data plane how to get data from point A to point B."},
{"question":"In a SDN (software defined network), what is the function of the Management Plane (application layer)?","answer":"This layer consists of network applications and services that communicate with the SDN controller. Applications on this layer can be used as an interface for devs/network managers to adjust and define specific network requirements and policies for the device. For instance, define routing tables on this layer, which get used in the control layer / control plane."},

It can also cache data for other users of the proxy."},

{"question":"What is a CRL? What is OCSP?","answer":"Certificate Revocation List. It is a periodically updated list managed by a Certificate Authority (CA). It contains a list of serial numbers of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date. The browser, upon receiving a certificate from a website, can check its serial number against the CRL published by the CA. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is another method where the browser queries the cert status from the CA directly."},
{"question":"What is WPA3? How does it improve upon WPA2?","answer":"WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is the latest generation of security protocols for protecting a wireless network, introduced in 2018. With the older WPA2, the PSK (pre-shared key, or, the WiFi password) is hashed and transmitted over the network. A hacker could potentially get that hash brute force it to reverse-engineer the PSK. WPA3 no longer sends the PSK hash over the network, no four-way handshake, and introduced stronger methods of encryption with GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol) which includes: SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) where everyone uses a different session key which are created on the devices; MIC (message integrity check), and GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code)."},

{"question":"Difference between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning?","answer":"Penetration Testing involves simulating an attack on an application or system. It tries to exploit vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Scanning, on the other hand, is less invasive - it only produces reports where vulnerabilities may lie."},

{"question":"What is DLP?","answer":"Data Loss Prevention. It is a solution that identifies and stops the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data (data in motion). It applies to all kinds of data transfer. For example, you can have DLP solutions for email, USB transfer, data transmitting over a network, cloud-based DLP, etc."},
{"question":"What is EDR?","answer":"A scalable, often automated solution to responding to the constantly increasing number of malware variants that threaten our systems. EDR is often agent-based, and uses machine learning to perform root cause analysis (=how did this malware get on our system?) which can be used to find a way to remove the virus and prevent it from spreading."},
{"question":"What is XDR?","answer":"Extended Detection and Response. A more intelligent solution for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). Features a wider scope of threat detection, a deeper investigation than EDR. It can catch things that EDR may have missed or improperly categorized. It also features network-based and cloud-based detection, and can correlate network, endpoint, and cloud detection for a better, more holistic root cause analysis and threat prevention."},
{"question":"What is LDAP? What is X.500?","answer":"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network. It is a lightweight and efficient protocol designed for directory-based information lookup and modification. LDAP is often used to provide a centralized directory service, such as managing user accounts and authentication in a network. \n\nX.500 is a framework for directory structure used in LDAP. Defines a directory service architecture. This framework includes a set of standards for naming, directory operations, and security. X.500 uses Distinguished Names (DNs) to uniquely identify entries in the directory. DNs are specified as 'attribute=value' such as 'cn=widgetweb' etc. LDAP is the protocol for querying X.500 directories."},
{"question":"What is MAC? (Not MAC Addresses.)","answer":"Mandatory Access Control. It is a form of access control where users and objects are given security labels to determine what a user can access."}]
