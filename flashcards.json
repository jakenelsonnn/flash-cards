{"question":"What is EAP? what is it used for?","answer":"Extensible Authentication Protocol. It is an authentication framework used for port security. (\"Port\" here refers to the physical network ports on networking devices like switches, routers, or WAPs). It integrates with IEEE 802.1X process to validate a device (supplicant) is trying to access a network port."},
{"question":"What is a CRL? What is OCSP?","answer":"Certificate Revocation List. It is a periodically updated list managed by a Certificate Authority (CA). It contains a list of serial numbers of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date. The browser, upon receiving a certificate from a website, can check its serial number against the CRL published by the CA. Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is another method where the browser queries the cert status from the CA directly."}]
