{"question":"Oliver, a system administrator, is responsible for managing access to a cloud-based application. He wants to implement a flexible access control model that takes into account various attributes, such as user roles, location, and time of access. Oliver is looking for a model that can dynamically adjust access based on changing contextual factors. Which authorization model is being used in this scenario?\n\na. ABAC\nb. MAC\nc. RBAC\nd. DAC","answer":"a. ABAC.\n\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an authorization model that determines access based on a combination of attributes, including user roles, location, and time of access. ABAC provides a flexible and dynamic approach to access control, allowing administrators to define policies based on a wide range of contextual factors.
