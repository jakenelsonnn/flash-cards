Recent security audits suggest the need for better controls to prevent unauthorized physical access. Which of the following options would best enhance the security of the server room?\n\na. Installing biometric access controls on the entrance to the server room\nb. Maintaining a manual log book for employees to sign in and out when accessing the server room\nc. Requiring IT staff to be present at the entrance of the server room at all times\nd. Implementing a combination lock with a shared code for all IT staff members","answer":"a. Installing biometric access controls on the entrance to the server room.\n\nBiometric scanners, such as retinal or fingerprint scanners, offer a strong method of authentication that is difficult to forge."},
{"question":"What technique enhances the security of a password by adding random data to it before it's hashed?\n\na. Tokenization\nb. Hashing\nc. Salting\nd. Key Stretching","answer":"c. Salting\n\nSalting involves adding a unique, random value (salt) to each password before hashing it. This helps prevent attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) and makes it more challenging to execute attacks like password cracking through brute force or dictionary attacks."},

{"question":"A company's primary security measure for their sensitive server room is a biometric access control system. Due to a recent natural disaster, the biometric system is temporarily unavailable. Which of the following would be the BEST compensating control to implement immediately to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the server room while maintaining a similar level of security?\n\na. Set up a temporary key code lock on the server room door.\nb. Disable access to the server room until the system is repaired.\nc. CCTV\nd. Replace the biometric system with a standard key lock.\ne. Implement a sign-in/out log that is monitored by a security guard.","answer":"e. Implement a sign-in/out log that is monitored by a security guard.\n\nA sign-in/out log with a security guard would be the best compensating control because it would provide a record of all individuals accessing the server room and could be carefully monitored. While it's not as secure as biometric controls, it is a reasonable temporary measure that also ensures human oversight. Using a key code might still be secure but it doesn't provide an audit trail of who actually enters, as codes can be shared. CCTV is a deterrent and provides a record but does not control access. A standard key lock might be easy to implement but it is less secure than biometrics. A notice is simply a warning and does nothing to secure the area."},
{"question":"An organization is expanding its onsite data center infrastructure to accommodate a recent growth in remote workforce. They are concerned with the creation of a secure network architecture. In this scenario, which of the following would be the BEST solution to ensure secure remote access while minimizing the attack surface?\n\na. Use a jump server as the sole access point for network management.\nb. Install a virtual private network (VPN) for secure remote connections.\nc. Configure a proxy server to control and filter outbound internet traffic.\nd. Deploy an intrusion detection system at the network perimeter.","answer":"b. Install a virtual private network (VPN) for secure remote connections.\n\nImplementing a VPN would provide encrypted connections from remote locations to the data center, allowing for secure communication while limiting exposure to attacks. A proxy server primarily acts as an intermediary for users seeking resources from other servers and might not provide the necessary encryption for all communications. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are crucial for monitoring and detecting potential threats but do not directly provide secure access for remote users. While a jump server can provide a controlled entry point into a network, it's not as comprehensive for remote access security as a VPN, which also encrypts the data in transit."},
